# üî® Software Setup

## üìú Agenda
- Create a GitHub repository.
- Configure git repository.
- Install and Configure VS Code

```{note}
Don‚Äôt worry if it doesn‚Äôt work right. If everything did, you‚Äôd be out of a job.
```

## üíª Procedure

### Create a repo within the GitHub Classroom

1. If you don't already have a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account, go ahead and create one.
1. Once you have your account, browse to <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/_D0KthO4/" target="_blank">ECE487 Classroom</a>.
1. Select ‚ÄúAccept this assignment‚Äù
1. Browse to your repository. Note the url for your repository (save this link, it is the best way to check if your repo is updated).
1. Go to Settings and change your repository name to `ece487-YourLastName`, e.g., `ece487-baek`.

```{important}
Please name your repository as ece487-LastName. This will help instructors find your repository easily.
```

### Install Git

1. To download `Git for Windows`  go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">git-scm</a> and click on the link.
1. Run the setup file and install Git with the default settings. If you have a Mac, you don‚Äôt need to do this step because Git is already installed on your computer.
1. Make a new folder called `ece487_wksp` in your home folder, for example, C:\Users\stanley.baek\ece487_wksp.
1. Right-click on the `ece487_wksp` folder and choose `Git Bash Here` from the menu.   

### Enable SSH connection to your GitHub account

Skip this section if you already have set up the SSH connection to your GitHub account.
1. On Git Bash, generate a new SSH key, substituting your GitHub email address:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

1. When you‚Äôre prompted to ‚ÄúEnter a file in which to save the key,‚Äù hit `Enter`.
1. At the prompt for a secure passphrase, hit `Enter`.
1. Start the ssh-agent in the background and add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:
    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```
1. f
    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

1. Select the output on the terminal (ensure you select your GIT email at the end), right click, and select copy.
1. Open a web browser and sign in to your GitHub account.
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

    ```

1. In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
1. Click New SSH key
1. In the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù field, add a descriptive label for the new key, such as ‚ÄúMasterX‚Äù.
1. Paste your key into the ‚ÄúKey‚Äù field (contents of the .pub file).
1. Click Add SSH key.
1. If prompted, confirm your GitHub password.

- The figure below shows an example of a local `ece487_wksp` folder on your computer.

```{image} ./figures/workspace_folder.png

```

<br>

- Go back to the Git Bash terminal. If you have already closed it, right-click on an empty area inside the `ece487_wksp` folder and pick `Git Bash Here` from the menu.
- Type in `git remote -v` and press Enter.  You should see two lines that say `origin` is your remote repository on bitbucket.org for both fetching and pushing. 
- Type in `git remote add upstream https://stanbaek2@bitbucket.org/stanbaek2/ece487_wksp.git` (or copy & paste) and press Enter.  This will add the instructor‚Äôs repository as another remote source.
- Type in `git remote -v` and press Enter.  You should now see two more lines that say upstream is the original repository that you forked from.
- Note: The gif animation below has been adpated from ECE382. You must use ECE487 in place of ECE382.

<br>

- If the instructor‚Äôs code changes, you will be notified and you need to run `git pull upstream main` to get the latest updates on your local files.
- When you push or pull your code, you will use origin by default, which is your own GitHub repository.

### Install and Configure VS Code

- Download <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe">Python 3.10.11</a>. Run the file and follow the steps to install it on your computer. In the first window, ensure you check the box that says `Add to PATH!`
- To get VS Code, go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VS Code</a> and click on the download button for your operating system. Run the file and follow the steps to install it on your computer.
- When you install VS Code, make sure you check the last four boxes as shown in the picture below. This will let you use VS Code with Python and Git more easily.

```{image} ./figures/VSCode_Setup.png

:align: center
```
<br>

- To open the `ece487_wksp` folder with VS Code, right-click on it and choose `Open with Code` from the menu.
- To open the `Show All Commands` menu, go to Help and click on it, or press `Shift+Ctrl+P`. This is a useful menu that you will use a lot, so remember the shortcut `Shift+Ctrl+P`.
- To create a virtual environment for Python, type in the first few letters of `Python: Create Environment` in the `Show All Commands` menu and select it.
- Pick `Venv` to create a virtual environment.  
- Select the Python path that you want to use.  
- Select `requirements.txt` to install the Python packages that you need for this course.
- Wait for a few minutes until all the packages are installed.
- Click on the gear icon at the bottom left corner and select `Settings`. 
- Selct the `workspace` tab and click on the turn page icon at the top right corner. This will open `settings.json` 
- To copy the code for the virtual environment settings, open vscode.md and copy the code inside the curly brackets.
- Paste the code into settings.json and save it. This will make sure that the virtual environment starts automatically when you open the workspace.

<br>

- Open `README.md` and type in your name for author.  To save the file, press `Ctrl+s`.
- You should see the number 1 next to the `Source Control` icon.  Click on the `Source Control` icon and type in "initial commit".  
- Click on the arrow next to the `Commit` button and pick `Commit & Push` on the drop down menu.  

```{image} ./figures/GitCommitPush.gif
:width: 720
:align: center
```
<br>

- You can accomplish the same thing in `Git Bash`. 
- Open `Git Bash` and type in `git add -A` or `git add -all` and press `Enter`.
- Type in `git commit -m "Initial commit."` and press `Enter`.
- Type in `git push` and press `Enter`

```{tip}
There are also many third-party graphic user interface (GUI) clients. Check out https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis.

```{Attention} 
It is your responsibility to check your files have been successfully pushed to your Bitbucket repository. Always visit your Bitbucket repository after you push your assignments to the repository.
```

## üöö Deliverables

Take screenshots of the following and submit them via Gradescope.  Use `Snip & Sketch` (Win+Shift+S) in Windows 10 or Shift+CMD+4 in Mac to take a screenshot. Save it in `png` or `jpg`.  

```{warning}
Snap a picture of your computer screen with a mobile device or digital camera and then upload it to Gradescope. This will show that you have no idea what sampling aliasing (a concept covered in ECE215) is and you are not qualified for a bachelor's degree in ECE. You will lose 30 points every time you submit a picture of a computer screen taken by your phone or mobile device. And yes, I'm quite serious about this.
```

### Deliverable 1
- Provide a screenshot of your Bitbucket repository as shown below 
```{image} ./figures/BitbucketPushed.png

```

<br>

### Deliverable 2
- Provide a screenshot of your VS Code as shown below. Make sure you have the `.venv` and `.vscode` folders under the `EXPLORER` window.
